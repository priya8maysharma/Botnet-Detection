# Botnet-Detection
Botnets are a network of networked computers infected with malware and managed by a single attacker or a group of hackers. Botnet attempts to infect as many devices as possible and uses the resources of compromised devices to carry out automated malicious tasks. The majority of device owners are unaware that their device is infected with a botnet. Botnets are one of the most genuine dangers to the web today. The goal of this paper is to compare ML algorithms to historical botnet attack records. We can use the large number of botnet attack recordings we now have to train ML algorithms to detect future botnet detection.
